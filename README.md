# Captcha Solver Web Application

## 1. Project Title and Description

**Project Title:** Captcha Solver Web Application

**Description:** This is a simple, client-side web application designed to demonstrate a basic captcha solving interface. It displays a captcha image (provided as a data URI directly embedded in the HTML) and a text input field for the user to enter their perceived solution. This application is purely a front-end demonstration, focusing on the user interface and user experience for captcha interaction without implementing a backend validation system. It highlights how to display an image from a data URI and capture user input.

## 2. Setup Instructions

This application consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) and does not require any server-side setup, build tools, or external dependencies. It is designed for maximum simplicity and ease of use.

To run the app locally:

1.  **Save the file:** Save the provided `index.html` file to your computer.
2.  **Open in browser:** Navigate to the saved `index.html` file and open it using any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge).

The application will load directly in your browser without any further steps.

## 3. Usage Guide

1.  **Launch the application:** Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  **Observe the Captcha:** You will see a heading "Solve the Captcha" followed by an image (which represents the captcha).
3.  **Enter the Solution:** Examine the captcha image carefully. Type the characters or the solution you perceive from the image into the text box labeled "Enter solution here".
4.  **Verify (Front-end only):** Click the "Verify" button. Please note that in this front-end-only demonstration, clicking 'Verify' does not send data to a server, perform any validation, or check if your answer is correct. It merely simulates the user interaction flow of a real captcha system.

This application is intended for demonstrating the display of a captcha image via data URI and collecting user input.

## 4. Code Explanation

This Webpack Captcha Solver Web App is a single-page HTML application contained within `index.html`.

-   **`DOCTYPE html`**: The application uses standard HTML5 principles.
-   **Form Elements**: The core of the application's interface is a basic HTML form structure containing an `<img>` tag for the captcha image and an `<input type='text'>` element for the user's solution.
-   **Data URI Image Embedding**: The `<img>` tag's `src` attribute is set to a `data:image/webp;base64,...` URI. This means the entire image content is base64-encoded and directly embedded within the HTML file itself, eliminating the need for a separate image file. This fulfills the requirement of the image being a WebP format and served as a data URI.
    *   **_Note on Image Content_**: The original brief mentioned a `sample.webp` attachment. Since direct binary content was not previewed/provided for direct integration, a placeholder WebP data URI has been used in `index.html` for demonstration. In a real-world scenario, the actual `sample.webp`'s base64-encoded content would replace this placeholder.
-   **CSS Styling**: Basic CSS is embedded directly within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section. This styling provides a clean, centered, and responsive layout for the application, making it user-friendly. It styles the container, headings, image, input field, and button.
-   **No JavaScript Logic**: For this minimalist setup, no complex JavaScript is implemented. The page simply displays the elements and allows user input. Any dynamic behavior (like validating the captcha) would require a backend component, which is outside the scope of this front-end demonstration.
